	  <p>Geraze is an American rapper/Grinch enthusiast based out of the state of Maryland. Finding his humble beginnings in the 7th grade with his breakout hit "Thank You, Grinch," he began his slow rise to the top of the rap game. He knew what he had to do: save the rap game once and for all, and become the true form of The Grinch. His debut album, Asswipe, was released on October 7th, 2019, to critical acclaim.
Ever since that album dropped, he has been slaving away in the studio to release his sophomore album, "Whoville," set to release sometime between March-Early April.</p>
